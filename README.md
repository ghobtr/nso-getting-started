# NSO Getting Started Lab
This repository contains resources and labs designed to help engineers get started using [Cisco NSO](https://developer.cisco.com/nso). 

## Sample Network

If you have a lab network ready to go, feel free to use that - but we've included a [VIRL topology file](topology.virl) with this lab that we will use for our examples.  Feel free to fire ,up your own instance of this VIRL network either using your own VIRL server, or go reserve one from [DevNet Sandbox - Multi-IOS Test Network](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/6b023525-4e7f-4755-81ae-05ac500d464a?diagramType=Topology)
